# Privacy and Telemetry Notice

## Data Collection

The OSS Gadget software itself does *not* collect information about your
use of the software, and therefore does not send such information to any source,
including to Microsoft. Nevertheless, our privacy statement is located at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. 

However, OSS Gadget does make outbound network connections to various locations,
including NPM (registry.npmjs.org), NuGet (api.nuget.org), and RubyGems (rubygems.org).
These connections are unauthenticated and made directly to that service. As such,
their privacy policy would apply.

In addition, the health calculator (oss-health.exe) tool queries GitHub using the
public API. In order to do so, it needs an API key, which you would need to
include. This connection is therefore authenticated, between the tool and GitHub, and
as such, the [GitHub privacy policy](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)
would apply.
